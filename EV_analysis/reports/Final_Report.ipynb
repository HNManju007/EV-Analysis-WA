    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption patterns in Washington State using registration data. The goal is to extract actionable insights that support data-driven decisions in the automotive and EV manufacturing sector â€” aligned with Axion Rayâ€™s mission of improving product quality and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify top EV makes and models\n",
    "- Analyze range and pricing trends\n",
    "- Understand geographic adoption by county\n",
    "- Highlight insights to support strategy and policy decisions\n",

    "## 6. Key Insights & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insight:** Tesla holds a dominant market share in Washington.\n",
    "- **Insight:** EV ranges suit city travel, but rural infrastructure may need support.\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Expand public charging stations in underserved counties.\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Focus on high-demand counties for marketing and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis reveals critical trends in EV adoption and range patterns. It can help manufacturers, policymakers, and energy providers align efforts for better coverage, quality, and user experience â€” exactly the kind of impact a Junior Data Analyst at Axion Ray would contribute to.\n",
